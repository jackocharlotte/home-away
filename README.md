# Tile component

The Tile component is used to feature, or highlight a piece of content with an image and a short caption.

## Installation
* Clone the project
* `cd home-away`
* run `npm install`
* work locally using `npm start`

### Some notes about this project:

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to get it up and running.
* I used Sketch to create an SVG logo (matching the Home and Away logo.png) and optimized it using [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/).
